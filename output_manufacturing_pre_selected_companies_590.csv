It is headquartered at 200 Vesey Street, also known as American Express Tower, in the Battery Park City neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. Amex is the fourth-largest card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa, and Mastercard. 141.2 million Amex cards were in force worldwide as of December 31, 2023, with an average annual spend per card member of US$24,059. That year, Amex handled over $1.7 trillion in purchase volume on its network. Amex is the 16th largest US bank, with a total of US$270 billion in assets or 1.1% of all assets insured by the FDIC. It is ranked 77th on the Fortune 500 and 28th on the list of the most valuable brands by Forbes. In 2023, it was ranked 63rd in the Forbes Global 2000. Amex also owns a direct bank. Founded in 1850 as a freight forwarding company, Amex introduced financial and travel services during the early 1900s. It developed its first paper charge card in 1958, gold card in 1966, green card in 1969, platinum card in 1984, and Centurion Card in 1999. The ""Don't Leave Home Without It"" advertising campaign was introduced in 1975 and renewed in 2005. In the 1980s, Amex acquired and then divested a stake in Shearson. In the 1990s, it stopped reducing interchange fees for merchants who exclusively accepted Amex cards and expanded market share through targeted marketing campaigns. Amex converted to a bank holding company during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Amex began operating airport lounges in 2013, offering access to certain cardholders.",Payroll Cards | Personal Risk Insurance | Flight Ticket | Travel Guard Insurance | Corporate Travels,561510.0,Travel Agencies,492210.0,Local Messengers and Local Delivery,Banks & ATMs,Banks & Financial Services,Finance & Insurance,Software & IT Services,TC-SI,Technology,TC.1,Technology & Communications,TC,4724,Travel Agencies,Insurance Companies | Financial Planners / Advisors | Investment Institutions | Currency Brokers / Exchanges | Banks / Trust Companies (Accepting Deposits),7911,Travel agency activities,79.11,Travel agency activities,631001 | 641501 | 615001 | 625001 | 602101,496997973939.0,+61292718669 | +61293353492 | +61292714110 | +3617779777 | +18005420779 | +61282239171 | +61292713760 | +420222800100 | +61292718198 | +61292714496 | +61292718664 | +61292713574 | +61292714335 | +496975762325 | +61292712444 | +61292718298 | +61292718229 | +496997972222 | +61292714497 | +61292714011 | +34913778573 | +420222800333 | +61292714498 | +61292718666 | +496997973939 | +61292711510 | +12126402000 | +61292718678 | +496997972424 | +61292718655 | +18004466307 | +61292718722,se.travel@amexgbt.com,no-reply@alerts.americanexpress.com,ca-travelonline@service.americanexpress.com,https://www.americanexpress.com/de-de/,americanexpress.com,com,en,https://www.facebook.com/AmericanExpressCanada/,https://twitter.com/americanexpress,https://www.instagram.com/AmericanExpress/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-express,https://apps.apple.com/se/app/amex-se/id561144546?extlink=SWEDEN-WEB-AppSplashPage-iOSBadge,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amexnu&hl=de,https://www.youtube.com/user/AmericanExpressAU,,web servers: ibm websphere application server | javascript libraries: lodash | analytics: adobe analytics | miscellaneous: babel | web frameworks: vaadin | javascript libraries: core-js | javascript frameworks: angularjs -
